This homework (as well as the next few) builds upon the ray tracing code from the last two assignments.  It contains two header and two source files (as well as a short written portion, which also needs to be completed).  These source files should be added to the source files you already have from homework 2.  In addition, you will need to modify your existing registration.cpp file by uncommenting the lines related to the files you are adding.  If your program fails to parse the input files, you have likely not un-commented enough lines (or too many lines) in the registration.cpp file.  If parsing succeeds, you have done this correctly.

The zip file above also contains a directory called "test-hw4", which contains a bunch of new test cases; you will need to copy this over as well.  These are the test cases that will be used for grading the coding portion of homework 4.  You can run the grading script for homework 4 as "python ./grading-script.py test-hw4" .  Note that running "python ./grading-script.py tests-hw2" will continue to produce your grade for homework 2.  As you go, it is helpful to rerun the grading script from prior homework as well.  Although we will not be doing so while grading, it can help you identify regressions that may have been introduced on test cases that are easier to debug.  Note also that homework 4 builds on what you did for homework 2.  If you still have failing test cases for homework 2, you will need to fix those to pass the test cases for homework 4.
